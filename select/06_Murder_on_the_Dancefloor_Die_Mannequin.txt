I'm your neon zero
Your flourescent hero
I'm your neon zero
I'm your captain killer

I'm your neon zero
Your flourescent hero
I'm your neon zero
I'm your captain killer

Oh this sharade
That stands before you
I've been all cut up and arranged
To take you under
You just about to get yourself straight
You got the urge to
So shoot to kill or invade
And take me on

It's all arous, a sharade
That stands before you
I've been all cut up, re-arranged
To take you under
You just about to get yourself straight
You got the urge to
So shoot to kill or invade
So why you got the urge to lose?
Why you got the urge to-

Murder on the dancefloor
I am the killer in yr stereo
Cause it's a murder on the dancefloor
We set it lose like it's criminal
So all you girls, boys
Do the noise
It's our obsession
Oh no
Cause it's a murder on the dancefloor
(I'm your electric girl)
Murder on the dancefloor
(Come you electric girl)

A misery hero and I'm here to invade, invade
A sonic army and there is no escape
Electric junkies getting high like cocaine, cocaine
Us neon zeros we the rebels in reign

It's all arous, a sharade
That stands before you
I've been all cut up, re-arranged
To take you under
Will you surrender my name?
You got the urge to
So shoot to kill or invade
To take you under
I'm your neon zero
I'm your neon zero
Why you got the urge to?
Murder on the dancefloor
I am the killer in yr stereo
Cause it's a murder on the dancefloor
We set it lose like it's criminal
So all you girls, boys
Do the noise
It's our obsession
Oh no
Cause it's a murder on the dancefloor
(I'm your electric girl)
Murder on the dancefloor
(Come you electric girl)

I'm your neon zero
I'm your neon zero

Murder on the dancefloor
I am the killer in yr stereo
Cause it's a murder on the dancefloor
We set it lose like it's criminal
So all you girls, boys
Do the noise
It's our obsession
Oh no
Cause it's a murder on the dancefloor
(I'm your electric girl)
Murder on the dancefloor
(Come you electric girl)
Murder on the dancefloor
(I'm your electric girl)
Murder on the dancefloor
(Come you electric girl)
