It's a murder on the dance floor (Dance floor)
But you better not kill the groove, hey, hey
It's a murder on the dance floor (Dance floor)
But you better not kill the groove
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
About your kind
And so, and so, and so, and so, and so, and so, and so
I'll have to play

If you think you're getting away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way
Boy, just come along
Hear me when I say, hey

It's a murder on the dance floor (Dance floor)
But you better not kill the groove, hey, hey
It's a murder on the dance floor (Dance floor)
But you better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
There may be others
And so, and so, and so, and so, and so, and so, and so
You'll just have to pray

If you think you're getting away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way
Stay another song
I'll blow you all away, hey

It's a murder on the dance floor (Dance floor)
But you better not kill the groove, hey, hey
It's a murder on the dance floor (Dance floor)
But you better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down
It's a murder on the dance floor
But you better not steal the moves, hey, hey
It's a murder on the dance floor
But you better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna turn this house around somehow

Hey, hey
